Escalus
=======

Escalus is Erlang library for convenient testing of XMPP servers.
It's intended to be used with Common Test.

Escalus is aimed at checking correctness of XMPP server behaviour,
in contrast to tools such as Tsung which are about stress testing,
and don't verify correctness.

Quick start
===========

Read the [the intro file](docs/intro.md) to get started.

Standalone Escalus application
==============================

If you're interested in using Escalus as a standalone Erlang XMPP client
library (without any reliance on Common Test),
then see [standalone usage preqrequisites](docs/standalone.md).
